bootstrap-presentation
======================

Resources for Ryan's Bootstrap presentation at the first GCC event.

Overview
--------
We will be using a combination of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), and [LESS](http://lesscss.org) along with traditional HTML to create a beautiful responsive website that you can use to show off whatever you'd like. Participants will learn about LESS/CSS syntax and how HTML can structure a web page.

HTML
----
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a way of writing information in a structured format so that web browsers can interpret it as a web page. HTML is the backbone of almost every single website on the internet.

CSS
---
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to add style to the look and formatting of a webpage. CSS is not concerned with the actual content of a website, it focusses instead on the presentation of the content.

LESS
----
LESS allows developers to write CSS code much faster and cleaner than they usually would. LESS allows us to take shortcuts in developing a website by writing simple code that can be compiled into CSS.

Javascript
----------
Javascript is a very popular language for making websites responsive to a user's input. It let's us create a website that a user can interact with and perform various functions.

Bootstrap
---------
Bootstrap is a *framework* that we can add to our regular development of a website using Javascript, HTML, and CSS/LESS. Bootstrap takes care of a lot of layout and formatting problems for us and makes our websites really easy to create by simply following a template.
