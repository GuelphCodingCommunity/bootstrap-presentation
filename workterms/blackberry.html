      When I was in the fifth grade, I bought a copy of Interplay's &quot;Learn to Program Basic&quot; from a Scholastic magazine flier.
      </p>
      <p>
      It was terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
      The characters were confusing, the cut scenes increasingly maddening, and yet,  I fell in love with programming. This was the type of interactive tutorial finally perfected by sites like CodeCademy that held your hand while you learned all about the intricacies of variables and functions. The animated tutor who had a CD-ROM for a face and a dog for a companion would encourage you as you stepped through the levels, creating games and animating sprites. Now I finally had a reason to use the beast of a computer my parents had been so good to invest in, one of those ridiculously expensive towers that had a couple megabytes of memory and a processor that was still measured in megahertz. Over the next few years I would try my hand at controlling my computer using the-little-black-box, copy/pasting HTML, and (finally) Python.
      </p>
      <p>
      Computer Science in university is what I was after all along. Here I can spend long nights writing code with likeminded friends, making terrible jokes, and delivering software that I'm proud of. This will mark the start of my fifth semester at the University of Guelph, and having just spent the last eight months on my first work term with Research In Motion, I'll be coming back even more prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
      RIM has taken a lot of grief in the news in recent years for largely ignoring the increasing market for smartphones, as such I wasn't sure what to expect of the general atmosphere upon arriving, but I was impressed. The software developers I was working with were optimistic about the new direction the company was heading, my manager Tony Bridges was downright ecstatic at times about the new features being developed, and it was infectious. While not working directly on these new features ourselves, we were responsible for the Continuous Integration (CI) of new work.
      </p>
      <p>
      CI is crucial, the programmers are responsible for taking all of the work R&amp;D is doing and making sure that it's not going to go ahead and break all of the existing code. Every time a developer submits something new, its our job to take it, compile it, test it, and figure out what breaks. RIM is a huge company, and starting my first real foray into the world of software production seemed daunting: where could I find definitions for all of the Three Letter Acronyms? who could I ask about this specific line of code? how many servers does a company really need?
      </p>
      <p>
      Sometimes, eight months didn't seem long enough.
      </p>

      <h2>Research In Motion</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
        &quot;Research In Motion (RIM), a global leader in wireless innovation, revolutionized the mobile industry with the introduction of the BlackBerry® solution in 1999.
        </p>
        <p>
        The BlackBerry product line includes the BlackBerry® PlayBook™ tablet, the award-winning BlackBerry smartphone, software for businesses and accessories. BlackBerry products and services are used by millions of customers around the world to stay connected to the people and content that matter most throughout their day.”
        </p>
        <small>Research In Motion</small>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      RIM can be thought of as divided into two main sections: Devices and Enterprise. I worked for the latter half of the company. The Blackberry line of products has been an industry standard for years now, controlling a huge section of corporate devices that are trusted for their reliability and their security.

      RIM is spread out over a number of countries and towns, I undertook my work term at the main headquarters in Waterloo, ON. There are over 20 RIM buildings scattered across Waterloo, congregated around RIM Park (near Laurier University) and Northfield Campus (north of the city). One of our team members even worked in Mississauga and video called every morning for our daily meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
      My official title was Software Developer for Continuous Integration. My immediate team consisted of X people: myself, my manager Tony, coworkers Mike, Bart, Yuhui, Richard, and Lawrence (a Guelph student as well, and a friend). Beyond that we had help from others who had expertise in specific areas such as machine configuration, build server maintenance, web design, and proxy management. At RIM, if you don’t know how to do something, there seems to always be someone who does, and email rules all.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Continuous Integration?</h2>
      <p>
      Have you ever gotten exhausted tracking down a bug in your code when you threw in a new module?
      </p>
      <p>
      Have you ever been flustered trying to find a revision of your program that you know is going to work? That’s where Continuous Integration (CI) comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
      As a CI developer I was responsible for three main things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Aggregate all of the developers code</li>
        <li>Compile and test the code</li>
        <li>Generate meaningful statistics from the test data</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      We went through quite a few systems at each of the three steps trying to achieve a good balance while I worked at RIM. None of them perfect. When it comes to CI it tends to be a matter of tradeoffs: do you want lots of speed or lots of customizability?
      </p>

      <h3>Aggregate Code</h3>
      <p>
      This step is commonly known as source control. At the university I gained some experience with Subversion and the svn command line client, at RIM they prefer Perforce. Perforce is the brute force revisioning system, anything you could possibly think to do with it is possible. Want to see a list of users that modified a file after it was branched but before it was merged into another repository? No problem. Because of these features perforce can get a little slow, especially when you have a bunch of developers all syncing down the latest code for an entire project, but the GUI more than makes up for it.
      </p>

      <h3>Compile and Test</h3>
      <p>
      This is generally where things get tricky. When you have a large project with lots of moving parts, you need to create a “build contract” to keep track of how everything fits together. Sometimes a module in one piece of the project will require a specific version of another piece, but only at a certain step in the compilation. Build contracts come in many different shapes and sizes, but they all accomplish the same thing: a blueprint for compiling and testing code. Since we worked with a lot of Java code, we had a lot of options to pick from.
      </p>
      <p>
      Ant gives the user complete control, it’s written in XML, and there’s a vast library of modules to support any function you can think of. Written by Apache, at first glance it appears to be the best tool for the job. But Ant has it’s downfalls: while XML gives it a good structure, it makes it much harder to read an maintain, a lot of the libraries are buggy and missing features, and it tends to be much lower level than other build solutions. Ant calls it’s functions “targets” and you can nest them however you like. They can invoke system commands, move files, connect to remote servers, and – of course – compile your program. Ant is best suited to projects that need to be highly customizable.
      </p>
      <p>
      The next option is Maven, also by Apache. Maven sought to do fix everything that Ant did wrong, bringing a much more high-level approach to build systems. Ant is to C, what Maven is to Python. Maven build contracts are also made from XML but in a much more structured way. Where Ant used XML tags to denote everything from variables to boolean expressions, Maven has a rigid definition of which tags are expected at each step. A maven contract is called a Project Object Model (POM) file, and it generally will list: which repositories to grab source from, dependencies for each module, needed plugins, and where to publish the results. At the expense of it’s shallow learning curve, Maven isn’t quite robust enough to easily work with low level processes, the only way to customize your contract is to write an entire Java plugin to accomodate your function. The documentation can be rather sparse.
      </p>
      <p>
      Last and certainly not least, I got a chance to work with Gradle. Gradle succeeds where the aforementioned fail by striking a harmonious balance between high and low end. Gradle is – in fact – just an extension of the Groovy programming language (which in turn, is an extension of Java). The syntax that Groovy and Gradle use was completely new to me, there is a great deal of emphasis on Lambda functions, closures, and associative arrays. It is a wonderful Object Oriented tool and has a special focus on collections of objects. The syntax isn’t quite procedural, and at times doesn’t quite look like OO either, it definitely takes a while to get used to but it is well worth the investment.
      </p>

      <h3>Generate Stats</h3>
      <p>
      A part so crucial it required a team member’s (mostly) undivided attention. Bart was a wonderful colleague who was primarily responsible for analysis of data coming out of test runs and finding new and inventive ways to shape that data. Used properly it can show how a project is progressing over time, and how various patches have effected the stability. The data was then used to create numerous graphs that demonstrate the project’s state and made available on a local site. Since a build is started whenever developers submit new code into the repositories, we had the system automatically email them on completion showing the effects of the new code.
